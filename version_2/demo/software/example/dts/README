Content of this directory should be generated from the design.
You should "Export hardware" locally to the design, and then
"Launch SDK" (both from "File" menu in Vivado GUI).
In the SDK, in the "Xilinx Tools/Repositories" menu you should
create the new local repository pointing on the device-tree-xlnx
directory. (You can produce it by calling:
git clone git://github.com/Xilinx/device-tree-xlnx.git )
After adding the repository, you should select
"File/New/Board Support Package" of "device_tree" type
(select "device_tree" in the Board Support Package OS").
You can leave the default name device_tree_bsp_0.
Then you can click "OK" or "Finish" in next dialog boxes
until you return to the main SDK window.
