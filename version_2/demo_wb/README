This directory contains demo project for Z-Turn board, based on my AXI4-Lite to Wishbone bridge.
At the moment the design is very simple, so no drivers are provided yet (no "software" directory).
The WB slaves may be accessed vie "devmem" program using the Linux image compiled in 
the "demo/software" directory. The base address for Wishbone slaves is 0x43c00000.

This demo will be extended in the nearest future so, that it will make full use of the OOC
capabilities.
Please note, that the AXI4-Lite to WB bridge is just "proof of the concept" version.
It supports only "classic standard" accesses.
