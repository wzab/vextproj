This is the working area for the new version, supporting the OOC synthesis.
The demo design is modified so, that the IPbus part is moved outside the 
BD (as Vivado does not allow to set OOC the sublocks of RTL blocks placed inside
the BD design).

Unfortunately, the IPbus had to be flattened to std_logic and std_logic_vector
components, as Vivado does not support complex types in BD external ports...

The demo design is now equipped additionally with two LFSR registers,
located at base addresses 0x4 and 0x8.
Writing to reg0 -> Sets the LFSR bits
Writing to reg1 -> Shifts the LFSR register 
Reading from reg2 -> Returns current value of the LFSR register
(the width and the polynomial are defined in the lfsr_test_a and lfsr_test_b
files).

The demo design is prepared to demonstrate problems with setting OOC blocks
with user defined types (as dicussed here:
https://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Synthesis/Vivado-OOC-compilation-of-entities-with-ports-of-user-defined/m-p/696209 ).
Therefore sources contain already the appropriate stubs.

If you try to set both instances of the LFSR blocks OOC in the Vivado GUI, you'll
experience problems with VHDL package which will be not available in all filesets.
The only way to fix it, is to add it in the Tcl console...

This will be handled automatically in the second version of VEXTPROJ.
